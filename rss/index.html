Sounds like a lot of hassle, why bother?  Well, because it's free as in lunch.  Read on and I'll show you how.</p>

<p>In order to edit the blog I run Ghost v0.6.4 locally in <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a> v0.10.9 on my Windows machine.  On changing content/ theme or adding/ editing a post I use <a href="https://github.com/leftofnull/buster.git">Buster</a> to transpile the dynamic content from the running <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> instance in to interim static html pages.  I then run some post-processing steps with <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> to produce the final version of the static html and assets (css, js, images etc.).  Finally I push those contents up to my <a href="https://github.com/markstownsend/markstownsend.github.io">GitHub</a> repo.</p>

<p>I've taken the additional step of having my own custom url so I paid for the registration (USD14) and I pay monthly for the DNS using <a href="https://dnsimple.com">DNSimple</a> which is USD0.80 on a maxed out (10 domains for USD8 per month) legacy Silver plan.  So it's not quite <strong>free</strong> but 80 cents a month for a blog takes some beating!</p>

<p>If you are going to take this route to host your blog then the following two links are invaluable and Alexander Kahoun is a legend.</p>

<p>My own modest contribution to the process can be found in the README on my <a href="https://github.com/markstownsend/ghost-builder">ghost-builder repo</a> which you are welcome to have.  Please star it if it helps you.</p>

<p>It's further worth understanding the limitations of <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> pages for hosting and why it's necessary to take all these steps.  Fundamentally <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> will only serve static content.  That means only exactly the files hosted on the server.  It will not serve content from an app like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>.  That's why you aren't hosting <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> but rather the output from the <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> application running on your local machine.  You are using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> because it is a beautiful way to blog and it is fully featured running locally.  But you could conceivably use another blogging platform and do the same sort of process to get it to emit static content which you then push in to your <a href="https://github.com/markstownsend">Github repo</a> to display using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
