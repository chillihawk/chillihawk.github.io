<h6 id="somepointsofclarification">Some points of clarification</h6>

<ol>
<li>End User Computing (EUC) while sometimes mentioned in the same context is something different.  I define this as the practice of end users consuming technology rather than creating it.  In my mind there is also an implication that the use of that technology is broadly inline with its expected use.  </li>
<li>I'm specifically discussing the creation of technology in this post as opposed to the use of an existing technology, for example: downloading and using a browser plugin that is non-standard for your organisation.  I include the latter practice under the broader umbrella of Non-standard Technology Use (NTU) to which many of the same arguments in this post apply but it's not under discussion here.  </li>
<li>I'm mostly discussing spreadsheet applications as that seems to be the predominant technology for end user development in the corporate space.  However batch files, shell files, PowerShell files, VBScript files, JavaScript files, Access databases, office macros are all available to be 'developed' by the end user on most corporate desktops. </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="whatsthelittledeal">What's the little deal?</h4>

<p>Many of you will be familiar with the issues that arise when non-experts develop applications and/ or when applications are developed in non-typical ways.  This is not an exhaustive list and I'd love to hear any others you can think of but here's a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>inexpert (probably) use of the language and tooling leads to wasted time</li>
<li>no independent testing leads to errors in production </li>
<li>no version control/ proliferation of old copies leads to wasted time and errors in production</li>
<li>no quality control leads to errors</li>
<li>no documentation leads to wasted time</li>
<li>no resiliency planning leads to wasted time when unexpected circumstances arise</li>
<li>opaque dependencies means applications depend on data/ connectivity/ user input/ accounts that is not obvious</li>
<li>'super glue' effect means applications get in to a corporate production environment and are very hard to remove</li>
<li>'tail wagging the dog' effect means processes form around the application and pretty soon you are 'opening the confirmation spreadsheet' rather than 'confirming the transaction'.  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of that basically boils down to <strong>errors</strong>, <strong>poor process</strong> and <strong>inefficiency</strong>.  That is all bad, I agree.  But it's not the really <strong>BIG</strong> deal.</p>

<h3 id="whatsthebigdeal">What's the BIG deal?</h3>

<p><img src="../assets/images/paymentProcessing.jpg" alt="" />
At one point in my professional past I worked for an organisation that did payment processing.  They processed millions of transactions daily, all across the globe and had very robust and suitable systems for this (and I dare say larger) workloads.  They also had over <strong>4000</strong> user developed applications.  Presuming every one of those applications had a single core use case then the end users in this business thought there were an additional <strong>4000</strong> ways to do this business!</p>

<p><strong>That is the BIG deal!</strong>  </p>

<p>This is interesting for so many reasons and I'll discuss a few in the next couple of paragraphs.  Let me first state however that I didn't dig in to this 4000 so I cannot make any empirical statements about the complexity of these applications, the duplication in this population (although I know from  anecdotal evidence that it certainly wasn't 4000 copies of the same spreadsheet), or the current use.  That certainly would have been nice to have but I'll continue without it in a more general sense of a mature business with a non-trivial number of user developed applications.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let's go!</p>

<p>Firstly, the payment processing business is very competitive and is only profitable at scale therefore any organisation that is in it must have the systems to do it.  They've got the core use cases covered.  They've got the non-core use cases covered.  They are working on new use cases, at scale.  If there were 4000 use cases they hadn't covered they'd be out of business.  So those applications represent wasted effort.</p>

<p>Secondly, looking at this from the point of view of organisational dysfunction, end users are the ones in the trenches, doing the job/ using the systems day in and day out and they have requirements that aren't being met.  They have 4000 of them!  I know from first hand experience that end users are not knocking up spreadsheets just for the fun of it and that many End User Developers find it is a frustrating process but, that frustration must have been outweighed by the frustration of an unmet requirement.  4000 times.  I think it's reasonable to suggest this evidences a degree of the technology department being out of touch with its user base and/ or the business management failing to communicate effectively with the employees.</p>

<p>Thirdly, looking at this from the point of view of individual responsibility, how can an end user who understands the payment processing business think there are an additional valid 4000 things the organisation should be doing?  There aren't!  Now, granted, there's typically no global view, in other words the end user doesn't know that they are making the 4000th UDA but they must know they are not expert developers and consequently they are doing something potentially dangerous for the business.  It's certainly true that the negative aspects of end user development are more widely known now than they once were.  But very often it is easier to 'just bang out a spreadsheet' than to raise a requirement against a strategic system and argue for it's escalation and prompt fulfillment.  So users have been doing the easy thing and not the right thing.   </p>

<p>Finally, looking at this from the point of view of business agility, these applications are business quick sand.  For all the reasons stated in the <strong>little deal</strong> section earlier, these applications tend to be very brittle.  They very often cannot be run: by a different user; on a different machine; on a different date; in a different context or with different data.  They are almost never scale invariant (in other words they will break with more volume) and they are almost never defect free.  They are invisible at a global level but indispensable at a local level meaning they don't feature in planning and strategy but they are an impediment to execution of that strategy.  </p>

<hr />

<p>In summary, in this post I've deliberately ignored the positives of end user development and instead focussed on the negatives.  Of those bad aspects I acknowledge the importance of the poor SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) practices but argue they are of secondary importance next to the issues of organisational dysfunction, communication, individual responsibility and business agility that the existence of large populations of user developed applications bring up in mature businesses.  As always, I'd be very interested in your comments.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
